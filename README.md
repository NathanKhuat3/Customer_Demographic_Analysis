 Analysis into the relationship between customer's demographic characteristics and marketing campaign response rate  
 [(Code)](https://github.com/NathanKhuat3/Customer_Demographic_Analysis/blob/main/project.ipynb)  

### PROJECT BACKGROUND

Mav Analytics is a small digital marketing agency providing its service to a new international grocery retailer client. The client's last few marketing campaigns have underperformed in regards to respondents. As a BI Consultant in Mav Analytics, I am working with the Marketing Managers to analyze the data of over 2240 customers to gain insights into how specific segments of customers have responded to past campaigns and provide recommendations to guide the agency's new campaign development. 

### Overview

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e28d83f-05cf-4fa1-917f-387bb421697c)

The last six marketing campaigns have not performed well with an average of 7% response rate per campaign. The latest campaign has performed significantly better than the others, which encourages further analysis into the specific characteristics of the last campaign. The second campaign also stands out as the worst performer in conversion rate and warrants further studies to facilitate a better understanding of pitfalls in campaign development.

### DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

**Age**

The customer demographic is primarily middle-age workers and pensioners with little to no youth group. The main customer population are aged 45 and above. The age groups that were most responsive to campaigns were the Early-midlife group (35-45 years old) and the seniors (65+ years old). These age groups are likely more receptive to certain types of products, particularly those that cater to health, retirement, or lifestyle enhancements. On the other hand, the age profile that is most resistant to campaigns is the Mid-life group (45-54 years old).

**Education**

The predominant proportion of the customers’ highest education level is the Bachelor Degree, indicating that the customer base are highly educated, and around ⅓ of this population responded to the campaigns. On the other hand, the most responsive group to past campaigns is PHD holders with roughly 50% conversion rate. This can suggest that highly educated customers, particularly those with advanced degrees, may find the campaign offerings particularly relevant or appealing. This trend can also be explained by the certain campaign products that these particular customer segment purchase, further investigation on this aspect can inform future marketing campaign.

**Marital Status**

Among non-respondents, the married rate is slightly higher than the married rate of respondents, suggesting that past campaigns mhave been marginally more appealing to single customers as opposed to those with partners. This can be due to single customers having more dispensable incomes, open-mindedness to new products and fewer financial considerations compared to those with partners. It is worth noting that married customers are also likely to experience more joint-decision-making processes and less susceptible to impulse purchases that are driven by campaigns. 

**Children**

The most significant number of customers either have no children or 1 child, with very few households having 2 children. Households with no children or teens appear to be more responsive to campaigns. This finding supports the analysis presented above regarding family vs single individual customers. Households with children may be less receptive to campaigns due to more financial commitment on essential-only products. 

**Income**

The average respondent tends to have income that is more than $10,000 higher than customers who did not respond. This is significant for campaigns that are aimed at directly influencing a purchase decision. However for campaigns that serve only the purpose of increasing brand awareness, this finding warrants further review as the grocery retailer may be neglected a substantial proportion of their customer based by placing too much emphasis on purchase-centric campaigns instead of efforts to raise brand awareness

**Country**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748026a7-5ba3-4392-994a-c7b2d32b821d)

Overall, the Western Europe region appears to be performing the best in customer engagement. Spain is the country where the majority of the company’s customer base resides, and this country also has the highest response rate to campaigns. Saudi Arabia and Canada should also be targeted for the next campaign as a considerable percentage of the company’s customers live here. Australia is performing relatively poor in terms of conversion rate despite being home to 7% of the customer base.

Complaint rate, method of purchase and the product spending distribution of customers does not appear to share any relationship with campaign conversion rate.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Target Responsive Age Groups and High-Education Customer Segments

 -  Focus the future campaign on the Early-midlife group (35-45 years old) and seniors (65+ years old) as they show the highest responsiveness. Tailor campaigns to their interests and needs, such as health-related products for seniors or lifestyle upgrades for the Early-midlife group. Similarly, PhD holders have shown to be the most responsive to campaign, consideration into creating specialized contents and offers for this group should be considered.

2. Engage Family Segment

- One direction for the future campaign is to target the married customer segment with discounts, bundled deals for the shared family experience.
- Healthy food and educational products may also appeal to this group. Messaging can also be tailored to center around savings, security and long-term value to attract these customers
- Kid-friendly packaging can be a focal point to target these customers, especially to encourage impulse purchase

3. Target High-Income Customers with Direct Purchase Offers

- A focus on quality and exclusivity is key to continue to appeal to this group, as most respondents tend to have a higher income and thus likely dedicate more attention to high-quality products.

4. Target Spain and Growing Markets

- Tailor regional-specific advertising in Spain as well as growing markets such as Canada and Saudi Arabia, consider endorsement from celebrities and other key regional franchises.
- In general, focus on developing regionalized campaign that cater to cultural preferences and needs

5. RFM Analysis Utilizaiton
- Utilize RFM analysis provided to further segment customers and provide targeted offers on certain groups of customers.
- RFM analysis can also inform the establishment of loyalty programs and exclusive rewards for customer retention
- Use RFM to balance the amount of effort on each customer group
- Target customers with high Recency scores for future campaigns
